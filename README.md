# Trial
Sick of paying for free trials once they've ended? Set a date for a trial and remind yourself to cancel it

# Setup

1. Run "setup.py" and enter in all of the inputs
2. Upload the files to a hosting platform like <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a>, make sure "trial.py" runs every day.
3. That's it! Once the date meets your inputted date, you will be emailed a reminder. So make sure to set the date a day or two before the trial actually ends.
